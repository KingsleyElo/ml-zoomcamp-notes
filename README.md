# ML Zoomcamp Notes

This repository contains my **personal notes and hands-on implementations** from the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp**.  
The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in machine learning by understanding concepts from first principles and implementing them step by step.

## 📚 Contents

This repository will grow over time as I progress through the course.

- Linear Regression
  - Understanding features and target variables
  - Model formulation \( g(x) \)
  - Intercept (bias) and weights (slopes)
  - Manual implementation of linear regression
  - Making predictions

_(More topics will be added as learning progresses)_

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Focus on **intuition and understanding**, not just libraries
- Implement algorithms **from scratch** where possible
- Use simple examples to explain core ideas
- Gradually move to optimized and library-based solutions

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Google Colab
- Markdown & LaTeX for explanations

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

- Open the notebooks in **Google Colab**
- Read the explanations alongside the code
- Modify parameters and experiment with the implementations

---

## 📌 Disclaimer

These are **learning notes**, not production-ready implementations.  
The focus is on clarity and understanding.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong machine learning fundamentals and progress toward becoming a **data scientist**.
